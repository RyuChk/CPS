-*- Composition of state machine

Composition Kind
    1. Spatial := How the components communicate between each other
    2. Temporal := When do component Executed.

-*- Sequential vs. Concurrent

    !Sequenctial                |               !Concurrent
    `Reaction independelty`                     `Simultaneous`


Temporal Composition of State Machine
    Concurrent := Asynchronous ( independelty ) --> Need interface actor model for state machine
    Sequenctial := Synchronous ( Simultaneous )
    
Set-Theoretic definition
    State_Machine := {

        Where {
            S := Set of state
            I := set of input symbols
            O := set of symbols
