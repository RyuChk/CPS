-*- Discrete Dynamic and state Machine -*-

    Continous vs. Discrete
  : System Can both flow    |   System can jump
    [Differential Euqation] |   [State Machine / Automation]


-*- Discrete 
    - Discrete is individually seperate / distinct
    - Sequence event occur at an *! Instant Time !*
    - Stack of step or task taken value
    \\ As step of ladder graph \\ State machine design

        Example : Garage car sensing

-*- Counter:
                     ____________
        Up    ----> |            |
                    |   Sum I    | -----> Output (Count)
        Down  ----> |____________|

    Input   := {up, down} => R {present, absent}
    Format  =    Input   :   ({up, down} --> {absent, present})
                 Output  :   ({count} --> {absent} U N)


-*- The model for integrator / Counter
    - Both integrator actor and counter have state

-*- Finite-state Machine / FSM
    - Called finite state for discrete model

    States := {State1, State2, State3}

Transitions :
 ____________
|            | guard / Action
|  State 1   |     ----->       Next state
|____________|

Signals Type
    Pure-Signal := Simple signal 0 / 1
    Time-Signal := Depend on time
-*- Hysteresis 
    - Looping !
    - StateChange by event trigger

Event-triggered model:
    - suppose all iput are discrete and reaction occures when any input is present.
    input := x = {present, absent}
    output := y = {present, absent}

Time-triggered model:
    - Suppose all input are discrete and reaction occur on tick of clock

Defualt transition:
    - Loop to itself where no guard / trigger are present.

Extended state machine:
    - Varialble which is not input of the machine.
