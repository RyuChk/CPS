-*- What is Embedded System? -*-
    - A computer system that have computer and software embedded into the product
    - Mainly use to perform dedicated function or independion task as part of larger system
    - * Mainly compose of microcontroller and microprocessors (microcontroller and microprocessors based system) * -

Main Characteristic
    - 1. Designed for specific task --> It is designed with sensor and software which only support task which it meant for.
    - 2. Tightly constrained --> Very important for packing it inside other product or system
    - 3. Reactive and Realtime --> Will react to change in enviroment in realtime.
    - 4. Memory --> It's software is embedded inside the memory (ROM)
    - 5. No UI
    - 6. Low Power

Computer component
    - 1. Processor
    - 2. Memory
    - 3. I/O output mechanism

Central Processing Unity( CPU )
    - ALU --> Perform arithmetical and logical operations on the data recievedสฟ
    - Register --> D flip-flop register word size memory
    - Control Unit ( CU ) --> control flow of data and instruction within computer ( As name said --> Control Unit )

Machine Cycle
    - Main activity perform my CPU to execute the program instruction stored within memory
